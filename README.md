# Shareabouts for WordPress

Inspired by it's big bro [Shareabouts](https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts), Shareabouts for WordPress is an online mapping tool for crowdsourcing public input about places. Easily drop pins on a map and have discussions about those places.

## Requirements

* [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
    * [PHP](http://php.net/)
    * [MySQL](http://mysql.com/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)/[GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [HTML5](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* JavaScript/[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/)
<!-- * [Carto](https://carto.com/) -->
* [Foundation for Sites](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites.html)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Bower](https://bower.io/)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

## Setup

* Download or clone the repo into the themes directory of your WordPress instance
* `cd  shareabouts-wp`
* Run `npm install` to get node_modules
* Run `bower install` to get bower_components
* Run `gulp` to compile the CSS & JavaScript

## Making changes

Run `gulp watch` to watch for changes to `.sass` and `.js` files

#### CSS

* Do not edit the files in `/assets/css/` — they're generated by Gulp
* Add your custom styles to `assets/scss/app.scss`
* Change the Foundation variables in `assets/scss/_settings.scss`
* Choose which Foundation component styles to include in `assets/scss/foundation.scss`

#### JavaScript

* Do not edit `assets/js/foundation.js`, `assets/js/leaflet.js`, `assets/js/scripts.js`, or their `.min` versions — they're generated by Gulp
* `assets/js/jquery.smoothState.min.js` was manually added to the repo — bower fetches wrong version
* Add/edit your custom JavaScript files in `assets/js/scripts/`
* All `.js` files in `assets/js/scripts/` will concatenate to `assets/js/scripts.js` and `assets/js/scripts.min.js`
* Choose which Foundation JavaScript components to include in `gulpfile.js`

## Upgrading

* When upgrading to a newer version of Foundation, make sure `assets/scss/_settings.scss` uses `@import '../../bower_components/foundation-sites/scss/util/util';` not `@import 'util/util';`.
